last_name, string
birthday, timestamp
phone, string
gender, string
care_driver_prefence, string
can_seat_in_front, boolean
booster_seat, boolean
organizer_id, int

----------------

TABLE NAME:
rides

####  4. Provide edge cases and how you would test them.

Api might create thousands or millions of rides depending on "repeat until" value. I would  set a limit for an interval between current time and repeat until date. 

I would add tests for all normal and abnormal cases.


####  5. Provide performance challenges and how you would address them.
